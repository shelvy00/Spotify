## Shelvy's Spotify App

Music app using Spotify API that allows user to search and play any song on Spotify.

### Project Description

In the searchbar, enter any artist/song you have in mind. The app will render a list of tracks on the screen. Once you click a card on screen, a new tab of the song on Spotify will open on your browser. From there you will be able to listen to the track on Spotify!

### Technologies Used

Spotify API, ReactJS, Semantic-UI

### Quick Start

-Download zip file or clone the repository on your local machine, and open it up in your code editor.

-In the terminal, run npm install to install all libraries allowing you to make request to Spotify API.

-Next, create a .env file in the root directory to store your Spotify Credentials as shown below: (name must have prefix of REACT_APP_)

REACT_APP_CLIENT_ID = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX REACT_APP_CLIENT_SECRET = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

-To get these credientials, you must go to My Dashboard, log in with your Spotify account. Click on "Create an app". Pick an "App name" and "App description" of your choice and mark the checkboxes. After creation, your "Client Id" will show and you can click on "Show client secret" to unhide your "Client secret".

-To refer to these variables anywhere in the project: process.env.REACT_APP_CLIENT_ID, process.env.REACT_APP_CLIENT_SECRET



### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
